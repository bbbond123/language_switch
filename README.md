# Language Switcher

**Language Switcher** is a macOS Menu Bar utility designed to streamline your multilingual workflow. It allows you to define custom sets of input sources (e.g., "Coding Mode" with English only, "Writing Mode" with English & Chinese) and switch between them with a single click.

This eliminates the need to manually add or remove input sources in System Settings when switching between different tasks.

## Features

- **One-Click Switching**: Toggle between your pre-defined language profiles instantly from the menu bar.
- **Custom Profiles**: Create unlimited profiles (e.g., `English Only`, `English + Chinese`, `English + Japanese`).
- **Native Experience**: Lightweight, native macOS application that lives in your menu bar.
- **Visual Feedback**: The menu bar icon displays the name of the current active profile.

## Usage

1. **Launch the App**: You will see a keyboard icon (or a `?` if unconfigured) in the menu bar.
2. **Configure Profiles**:
   - Right-click the menu bar icon and select **Settings...**.
   - Click **Add New Profile**.
   - Name your profile (e.g., "Code").
   - Select the input sources you want active for this profile.
   - Repeat for other scenarios (e.g., "Chat").
3. **Switch**: Left-click the menu bar icon to cycle through your profiles.

## Requirements

- macOS 11.0 or later.
- Accessibility permissions may be required to modify system input sources.
